I want a region editor component that lets me do:
Click adds region component
Drag point moves region point
Click on initial point completes region
External command clears region or part of a region
External command loads a region or part of a region


(0, 0) ---------------------------------- (500, 0)






(0, 500) ------------------------------- (500, 500)


The server should:
Serve the ELM application
Have a database containing information about the image files
Have a resource letting you list the image files and update their informations


Move the images to the server static directory.
Re-import them from there.
The annotator directory lives on but there is the ./build script that builds all its relevant stuff into server/static/html.



The regions should have their own table in the database.
Labels should have their own table in the database.
If a region has any labels, then deleting it should merely mark it as deleted so that the labels are still interpretable.
If a region has any labels, then modifying it should not be allowed.
At some point there might need to be a time column in the direction database for when the camera shifts.



The region labler should carry labels over from the previous frame so that I can click through them fast and only make changes when things change.
Clicking should toggle between occupied/unoccupied (instead of having an unlabled option) so that I need to do fewer clicks.

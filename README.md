This is a "Traffic Light Predictor". The goal is to have a server that watches public traffic webcams to predict when traffic lights will turn green. The server will send these predictions to my phone, so that my phone can tell me how fast I need to bicycle to hit all the green lights.

The other goal is to learn a bit about Elm and Haskell, so this repo has a bunch of random Elm and Haskell junk in it.
